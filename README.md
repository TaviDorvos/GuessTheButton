# GuessTheButton
A mini-project of TicTacToe I've made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

All you have to do is to insert a number(how many buttons will appear) and then you have to guess which one is the correct button.

## How to use?
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Open it in your browser.
3. Enjoy :)
